-------

My latest roll was as Staff Engineer at [Shopify](https://shopify.com).
* Grew my team from a small 5 person team to over 30 engineers across 4 sub-teams. I helped peers with individual technical growth through mentorship, pairing, and targeted delegation.
* Worked closely with other leaders to define long-term technical visions and short-term project roadmaps for how to achieve those visions.
* Directly lead and contributed to key performance and scaling projects such as:
  * Extracting and refactoring the tightly coupled billing component out of the core Shopify monolith into a developer focused platform
  * Refactoring and re-architecting applications so that their databases could be efficiently sharded & distributed
